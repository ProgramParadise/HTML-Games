# HTML-Games
Random games I have made for my site (but haven't gotten around to hosting)
<hr>
These are small games that I have programmed in my spare time. I plan on eventually adding these to <a href="www.programparadise.dev">my website</a>. However, I haven't gotten around to doing so because I have been busy with schoolwork.

My plan is to put my small "microprojects" on here while I prepare for major updates to my site.
